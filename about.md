Hi! My name is Kenan Klisura. I'm a Software Engineer, currently living and working in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. I'm a passionate about programming and I love learning new stuff be it in science, technology, eletronics. :)

I decided to write this blog to document my learning experience, to use it with Feynman technique and to leave notes for future reference. If I can help someone along the way with any of this, that'll be even better.
