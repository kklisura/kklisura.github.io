I was reading a lot about [NASA's Mars helicopter - Ingenuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenuity_(helicopter)), so I've compiled a list of links: materials and research papers about it. I'm mostly interested in hardware and software - especially in terms on navigation. All of the materials are easily obtained by googling them, so that's the reason I'm including links to them as well.

Since the Ingenuity uses COTS (Commerical Off-the-shelf) components, some of the navigation features could, in theory, be implemented using a smart phone ie using IMU and using camera as vision input for building a navigation demonstrator.
